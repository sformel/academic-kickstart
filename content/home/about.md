### About
I am a Ph.D. student in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Tulane University in the lab of [Dr. Sunshine Van Bael](http://vanbaellab.wp.tulane.edu/) in New Orleans, Louisiana. I 
currently focus on the how the salt marsh grass, *Spartina alterniflora*, and its microbial associates influence each other and are shaped by petroleum.

My CV is available [here](https://sformel.github.io/pdfs/SF_CV_May2018.pdf).
